# Project Overview

This study delves into the complexities of IDS using the CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, specifically focusing 
on brute force attacks targeting SSH and FTP. The research encompasses data cleaning, exploratory 
data analysis, normalization, and feature reduction using extraction techniques to streamline processing 
and reduce model complexity. Various ML algorithms like Decision Trees (DT), Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, MLP, 
and Random Forest were tested, with DT and RF showing promising outcomes.

The study's contributions include:

1. Investigating large datasets related to harmful network activities(CIC-IDS-2018-Brute-Force).
2. Identifying feature dimensions that impact classification performance, leading to improved 
detection accuracy.
3. Utilizing the CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset for NIDS and evaluating ML classifiers for detecting SSH 
and FTP brute force attacks.
4. Employing our custom setup for data collection, ensuring precise and relevant datasets for 
analysis and evaluation.
5. Presenting comprehensive performance evaluations, including CPU processing time and model 
size considerations, essential for intrusion detection systems' practical implementation and 
scalability.

Our evaluation of diverse ML classifiers for detecting SSH and FTP brute force attacks underscores the 
importance of algorithm selection in IDS design. Notably, the Decision Tree and Random Forest models 
emerged as top performers, showcasing remarkable efficiency in both training and prediction phases. 
These models exhibited high precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics, highlighting their 
robustness and suitability for real-time intrusion detection tasks.

Our study emphasizes the significance of feature selection methodologies, such as Random 
Forest-based feature reduction, in streamlining model complexity and enhancing processing speed. This 
approach optimizes resource utilization and facilitates the deployment of scalable and efficient IDS 
solutions in dynamic cybersecurity environments. Looking ahead, future research endeavors may explore 
advanced ML techniques, ensemble learning strategies, and integration of real-time threat intelligence to 
further fortify IDS capabilities.
